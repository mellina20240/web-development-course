                <h2>What do hamsters like ?</h2>
                <p>Hamsters enjoy a varied diet including seeds, nuts, grains, fruits, and vegetables. They also appreciate
                hamster-specific treats, and enjoy chewing on wood, cardboard, or chew toys to keep their teeth healthy. Furthermore,
                hamsters thrive with opportunities for play, such as running in a wheel, exploring tunnels, and hiding in various
                enclosures.</p>

            supplemented with fresh fruits and vegetables like carrots, broccoli, spinach, apples, and berries.</i>
                <h3>Chew Toys:</h3>
                <b>Hamsters have a natural urge to chew, and providing them with wood chews, cardboard tubes, or specially designed rodent
                chew toys helps keep their teeth healthy and provides enrichment.</b>
               <h3>Enrichment:</h3> 
            amsters have a natural urge to chew, and providing them with wood chews, cardboard tubes, or specially designed rodent
            chew toys helps keep their teeth healthy and provides enrichment.    Hamsters enjoy exploring and playing. Tunnels, hideaways, solid-surface exercise wheels, and other toys can help prevent
                boredom and promote physical activity.
